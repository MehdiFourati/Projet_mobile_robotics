    "### Initial choices\n",
    "* Environment: we decided to use a simple blue floor with black obstacles and a red objective to have a strong contrast between them and the robot to make the vision easier. The obstacles can have any shape, which make the math heavier but more representative of the reality.\n",
    "* Global navigation: the path from the starting point to the goal is computed using Dijkstra's algorithm. We decided to use Dijkstra's algorithm to allow us more flexibility in case we wanted to further complexify the problem and add some intermediary goals (which doesn't work with heuristics based algorithm such as A*). The points that the algorithm uses are the vertices of the obstacles approximated a bit more than half the robot's width away to avoid crashing into them while taking the uncertainty into account. \n",
    "* Pose estimation : the filter we used to estimate the pose and to control the robot is an extended Kalman filter. We chose it because all the prerequisite for its use where fullfilled and it is the de facto standard in navigation systems [[1]](#1).\n",
    "* Motion control: we used a standard P-lead controller to make the robot follow the trajectory. As the trajectory is linear and the odometry reasonably good (the same speed on the two wheels will make the robot go straight with very little error), we don't need to make it more complex and use a PID controller or any othere more complex.\n",
    "* Local navigation: this part makes the robot avoid crashing into obstacles if it senses something right in front of him. The shape of the obstacles is not relevant: the robot will move around it in the direction where it didn't sense anything. If all the sensors sense something, i.e. the robot is in a corner, it will do a 180Â°.\n",

We must then cast this raw FoP onto a perfect rectangle more representative of the reality. To do this, we use a perspective transformation. We begin by approximating the contour by a four sided polygon using a Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which recursively divide the original contour until the variation between the newly computed contour and the original one is the one specified[[2]](#2). Once we have our 4 vertices, we compute the matrix casting them onto a perfect rectangle of width and height same as the maximum width and height of the polygon. We then apply this matrix to make a perspective transform of the raw video feed.

Using average variables for the left and right sensors offers several advantages. It simplifies the code by reducing repetition, making it more readable and easier to understand. The average also helps smooth out variations or noise from the sensors, providing a better estimation of obstacle proximity. By directly comparing two averages (left and right), decisions become more balanced and easier to manage. Finally, this approach makes the code more modular and easier to maintain, as any changes to the sensors can be centralized in the average calculation. Here, we use the five horizontal front sensors because the center sensor detects a frontal obstacle, while the other four determine whether the obstacle is more to the left or the right using the average variables <i>close_left</i>  and <i>close_right</i> .
